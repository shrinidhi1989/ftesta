Jesus Christ! Eternal Sweetness to those who love Thee, joy surpassing all joy
and all desire, Salvation and Hope of all sinners, Who hast proved that Thou
hast no greater desire than to be among men, even assuming human nature at the
fullness of time for the love of men, recall all the sufferings Thou hast
endured from the instant of Thy conception, and especially during Thy Passion,
as it was decreed and ordained from all eternity in the Divine plan.Remember, O
Lord, that during the Last Supper with Thy disciples, having washed their feet,
Thou gavest them Thy Most Precious Body and Blood, and while at the same time
Thou didst sweetly console them, Thou didst foretell them Thy coming Passion.
Remember the sadness and bitterness which Thou didst experience in Thy Soul as
Thou Thyself bore witness saying: &quot;My Soul is sorrowful even unto
death.&quot; Remember all the fear, anguish and pain that Thou didst suffer in
Thy delicate Body before the torment of the crucifixion, when, after having
prayed three times, bathed in a sweat of blood, Thou wast betrayed by Judas,
Thy disciple, arrested by the people of a nation Thou hadst chosen and
elevated, accused by false witnesses, unjustly judged by three judges during
the flower of Thy youth and during the solemn Paschal season. Remember that
Thou wast despoiled of Thy garments and clothed in those of derision; that Thy
Face and Eyes were veiled, that Thou wast buffeted, crowned with thorns, a reed
placed in Thy Hands, that Thou was crushed with blows and overwhelmed with
affronts and outrages. In memory of all these pains and sufferings which Thou
didst endure before Thy Passion on the Cross, grant me before my death true
contrition, a sincere and entire confession, worthy satisfaction and the
remission of all my sins. Amen.</span></p>

Thou didst complain bitterly of those hopeless lost and unfortunate sinners.

multitude of wounds with which Thou was covered from head to foot, torn and
reddened by the spilling of Thy adorable Blood. O Great and Universal Pain
which Thou didst suffer in Thy virginal Flesh for Love of us! Sweetest Jesus!
What is there that Thou couldst have done for us which Thou hast not done!. May
the fruit of Thy sufferings be renewed in my soul by the faithful remembrance
of Thy Passion, and may Thy Love increase in my heart each day, until I see
Thee in eternity, Thou Who art the treasury of every real good and every joy,
which I beg Thee to grant me, O Sweetest Jesus, in Heaven. Amen.</span></p>

Jesus! Strong Lion, Immortal and Invincible King, remember the pain which Thou
didst endure when all Thy strength, both moral and physical, was entirely
exhausted, Thou didst bow Thy Head, saying: &quot;It is consummated!&quot;. Through
this anguish and grief, I beg of Thee Lord Jesus, to have mercy on me at the
hour of my death when my mind will be greatly troubled and my soul will be in
anguish. Amen.</span></p>

Jesus! Only Son of the Father, Splendor and figure of His Substance, remember
the simple and humble recommendation Thou didst make of Thy Soul to Thy Eternal
Father, saying: &quot;Father, into Thy Hands I commend My Spirit!&quot; And
with Thy Body all torn, and Thy Heart Broken, and the bowels of Thy Mercy open
to redeem us, Thou didst Expire. By this Precious Death, I beg of Thee O King
of Saints, comfort me and help me to resist the devil, the flesh and the world,
so that being dead to the world I may live for Thee alone. I beg of Thee at the
hour of my death to receive me, a pilgrim and an exile returning to Thee. Amen.</span></p>

Jesus! True and fruitful Vine! Remember the abundant outpouring of Blood which
Thou didst shed so generously from Thy Sacred Body as juice from grapes in a
wine press. From Thy Side, pierced with a lance by a soldier, blood and water
issued forth until there was not left in Thy Body a single drop, and finally,
like a bundle of myrrh lifted to the top of the Cross Thy delicate Flesh was
destroyed, the very Substance of Thy Body withered, and the Marrow of Thy Bones
dried up. Through this bitter Passion and through the outpouring of Thy
Precious Blood, I beg of Thee, O Sweet Jesus, to receive my soul when I am in
my death agony. Amen.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span lang=EN-US>O
Sweet Jesus! Pierce my heart so that my tears of penitence and love will be my
bread day and night; may I be converted entirely to Thee, may my heart be Thy
perpetual habitation, may my conversation be pleasing to Thee, and may the end
of my life be so praiseworthy that I may merit Heaven and there with Thy
saints, praise Thee forever.</span></p>
